1). Explain JRE,JDK,JVM?
JDK : Java Development Ket, it consists of JRE(Java Run Time Environment), Development tools and Compiler.
The ccompiler will convert the source code into the bytecode.
JRE : Java Runtime Environment, it consists of JVM and Set of Liberies. It Provides Runtime environment.
JVM : Java Virtual Machine , it performance three major operations. 
1. It Collects the bytecode.
2. It verifies the bytecode.
3.It Interprites the bytecode line by line.

2). Explain the following
1.Class:- The class is the blueprint/design with status and iyygj buuyr.
Objects :- Objects are the Instance of class.
static :- The static is a keyword that is used to convert instance variable or method into a static variable or static method.
public :- This keyword is used when the files are stored in different classes so that we can access them from the other.
private :- this keyword is used to make the files private. we can,access this kind of files/info from different classs.

2. public static void main(String []args)

public :- Access modifier(Keyword).
static :- modifier(Keyword).
void  :- Return Type.The return value for void is optional.
main :- Method name.
String []args :- are used to pass the arguments.

3.System.out.println();
System :- class(package:-Java.lang.System).
out :- keyword.
Println():- Method(println:- print in next line).

3).What is an array?
Array is used to store a group of values which is of similar datatypes.
example :-  int var[] ={1,2,3,3,44,5,5,6,6};
char rt[] = {'g','h','j'};

5). Data Types : The Datatypes are used to represent the types of values that are stored in variables.
There are two types of datatypes.
1.Primitive Datatypes
2.Non-Primitive Datatypes

1].Primitive Datatypes : The values for Primitive datatypes are predefined. The Primitive datatypes are of eight types, There are:
	1}.Byte :- Stores Integer type of data. ex:- byte a= 1;
	2}.Short :- Stores Integer type of data. ex:- short s= 12;
	3}.int  :- Stores Integer type of data. ex:- int d= 13457628;
	4}.float :- Stores Integer type of data with decimal points. ex:- float g= 1.9f;
	5}.double :- Stores Integer Type of data with decimal points . ex :- double j= 0.00d;
	6}.long :- Stores Integer Type of Data . ex :- long a= 8296699016l;
	7}.Char :- Stores charaters. ex:- char v = ' '.
	8}.boolean :- shows ture or false. default value for boolean is false.
	
2].Non-Primitive Datatypes : The Values of non primitive datatypes are not pre-defined.

6). Variables : The variables are the container in the java memory that stores the values.
There are 4 types of variables:-
1.Local Variables.
2.static variables.
3.Instance Variables.
4.Parameter Variables

7). What is Constructor/ When is the class constructor invoked? will a class contain multipl constructors? Explain its types with an examples.
A constructor is a special type of method that has name similar to class name with no return type.During Object Creation The constructor is invoked.
No class Can not have multiple constructors.
There are two types of constructors
1. default constructor
ex:-
public class Varun{
Varun(){
}
}
2. Parameter Constructor
ex:-
public class Varun{
Varun(int a){
}
}

8.Explain java features

The features of java are :-

1.Java Is Platform Independent :- You can write the code once and run that compiled files in different OS.
2. Java Is Secure : - It Provides Security Packages.Java Files are free from virus and Threats of hacking.
3.Java is internationalized
4.Java is multi Threaded
5.Object Oriented
6.simple
7.Portable
8.no pointers
9). Write Once and Run Anywhere :- That Source code is compiled in Operating System can be run in different Operating System.


10).Static methods and variables are used to convert Instance Variables and Methods into static variables.

11). Purpose of Default Constructor :- The default Constructor  is used to create an object.
ex: 
public class Varun{
String name;
varun{
}
varun ref = new Varun();
ref.name = "varun";
}
